# MonoDepth - Monocular Depth Estimation via Transfer Learning (Tensorflow 2.0)

My take on implementing monocular depth estimation based off of the state-of-the-art technology currently being used. This is an implementation in tensorflow 2.0 of the following paper - [High Quality Monocular Depth Estimation via Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11941), by Ibraheem Alhashim and Peter Wonka, in 2018.

The results were quite successful, although, very similar to what was achieved in the paper listed above. Therefore, if you would like to see the results, please refer to the paper as the authors deserve your attention on this more than this repo does. Enjoy!
