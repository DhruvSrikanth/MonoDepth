# MonoDepth - Monocular Depth Estimation via Transfer Learning (Tensorflow 2.0)

My take on implementing monocular depth estimation based off of the state-of-the-art technology currently being used. This is an implementation in tensorflow 2.0 of the following paper - [High Quality Monocular Depth Estimation via Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11941), by Ibraheem Alhashim and Peter Wonka, in 2018.

The results were quite successful, although, very similar to what was achieved in the paper listed above. I was able to achieve an accuracy of 97%. The results can be seen within the source code directory. However, if you would like to see some more detailed results, please refer to the paper listed above. Enjoy!
